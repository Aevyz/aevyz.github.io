### Creating a Commit
Now assuming you have any changes you wish to publish, such as any new posts or some new site feature, you can make use of Gitkraken to help you upload these to Github.

First of all, select the item which has a text bar containing the words `//WIP`.

![Select Commit]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tutorial/selectcommit.png "Select Commit")

Now a bar on the right appears, which details the changes you have made, prompting you to stage the changes made. In simplified terms, do you wish to make the changes listed here.

>Note: If no changes have come up, you likely have forgotten to save your files in Atom.

You can either stage files individually by hovering over them and pressing the `Stage File` button, or you can simply press the `Stage all changes` button and automatically stage them all.

From the files that you have staged, you can create a commit. It is a sensible idea to give them an appropriate name and description, as this will make your life a lot easier in the event you need to revert changes to your site. When you are ready you can simply hit the commit button.

Finally you can upload your posts to the Github servers by simply hitting the `Push` button in the top bar.
