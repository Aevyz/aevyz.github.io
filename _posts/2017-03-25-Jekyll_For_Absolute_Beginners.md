# Github Sites for Beginners Without Programming Expierience

### Goal
In this series of Blog Posts, I hope to make life easier for all people trying to make a Github Site, with little to no knowledge of programming.


### What is a Github Site?
Github Sites are powered by Jekyll, which basically takes your text files and applies them onto a template, which then generates a webpage that can be hosted on a webserver. The Websites created are known as static web pages.

Jekyll makes it really easy to make blogs, such as this one, as you simply need to write out your posts in a text file, place it into the `_posts` folder and it shall automatically generate a webpage for it.

Here is the code used to generate this page:

### What you are going to need
* A Github Account ([Register](https://github.com/join?source=header-home))
* A Text Editor of Choice (I Personally Recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/))
* A Git Client* (I Personally Recommend [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/))


_*While this is not necessarily required, it does make life a lot easier._

With that, you can now start with the guide.
